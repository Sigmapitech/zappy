# Setting Up Documentation for ZAPPY Project

This guide explains how to install the necessary tools and dependencies to generate comprehensive documentation for the **ZAPPY** project using **Doxygen** with the **Doxygen Awesome CSS** theme.

---

## 1. Required Software and Dependencies

### 1.1 Doxygen

- **Purpose:**
  Doxygen is the main tool used to generate documentation from annotated C, C++, and Python source code. It extracts comments and produces nicely formatted HTML pages (and other formats if needed).

- **Installation command:**

```bash
sudo apt install doxygen
```

---

### 1.2 Graphviz

- **Purpose:**
  Graphviz generates graphical diagrams such as class inheritance trees, call graphs, and collaboration diagrams. Doxygen uses it to create visual representations of your code structure.

- **Installation command:**

```bash
sudo apt install graphviz
```

---

### 1.3 (Optional) LaTeX (texlive)

- **Purpose:**
  If you want PDF output of your documentation, Doxygen can produce LaTeX files which are compiled into PDFs. For this, you need a LaTeX distribution like texlive.

- **Installation command:**

```bash
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
```

---

## 2. Doxygen Awesome CSS Theme

- **Purpose:**
  Enhances the look and feel of the HTML documentation generated by Doxygen with a modern, clean, and responsive design.

- **Installation:**
  Download the [`doxygen-awesome.css`](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) file from the repository and include it in your documentation folder (e.g., `.doc/`).
  Then, configure your `Doxyfile` to use it as an extra stylesheet.

---

## 3. Summary of Installation Commands

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install doxygen graphviz
# Optional for PDF output:
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
```

---

## 4. Configuring Doxygen to Output to `.doc/` Folder

1. Generate a base configuration file:

    ```bash
    doxygen -g Doxyfile
    ```

2. Edit `Doxyfile` with your favorite editor and modify or add these lines:

    ```ini
    # Set the output directory for all generated files:
    OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = .doc

    # Project info
    PROJECT_NAME           = "ZAPPY"
    PROJECT_BRIEF          = "A Tribute to Zaphod Beeblebrox"

    # Input sources (adjust paths accordingly)
    INPUT                  = ./src ./include ./ai
    FILE_PATTERNS          = *.c *.cpp *.h *.py
    RECURSIVE              = YES

    # Output formats
    GENERATE_HTML          = YES
    GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

    # Source browsing
    SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES
    INLINE_SOURCES         = YES

    # Graphviz settings
    HAVE_DOT               = YES
    DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT       = svg
    DOT_PATH               = /usr/bin/dot

    # Extra stylesheet for Doxygen Awesome CSS
    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome.css

    # Enable Markdown support
    MARKDOWN_SUPPORT       = YES

    # Warnings for undocumented members
    WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED   = YES
    ```

3. Place the `doxygen-awesome.css` file inside the `.doc/` folder (or the folder you set as `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`).

---

## 5. Generating Documentation

Run:

\```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
\```

All documentation files (HTML, diagrams, etc.) will be generated inside the `.doc/` folder.

---

## 6. Viewing the Documentation

Open the main HTML page in your browser:

```bash
xdg-open .doc/html/index.html
